# CrushApp Program  ðŸ’»

## Description

**CrushApp** is a simple Java application that calculates the age difference between the user and a predefined "crush" age. Based on the calculated difference, it outputs whether the age gap is appropriate, too large, or humorously suggests that the crush might be "like a sister."

## Features

- **User Input**: Prompts the user to enter their age.
- **Age Calculation**: Calculates the age difference between the user's age and a predefined age of 18.
- **Conditional Output**: Provides different responses based on the age difference:
    - **"Too young for you buddy!"** _if the user is more than 10 years older._
    - **"Damn it! She's technical your sister!!!"** _if the user is more than 2 years younger._
    - **"We are good to go!!!"** _if the age difference is within an acceptable range._
## Notes

- **Data Types**: The `ruge` variable is declared as an `int` to handle the arithmetic operation safely.
- **Resource Management**: The `Scanner` object is closed at the end of the program to prevent resource leaks.
- Java version 22.0.2
